abstract = {The use of interactive technology in the arts has changed the audience from viewer to participant and in doing so is transforming the nature of experience. From visual and sound art to performance and gaming, the boundaries of what is possible for creation, curating, production and distribution are continually extending. As a consequence, we need to reconsider the way in which these practices are evaluated. Interactive Experience in the Digital Age explores diverse ways of creating and evaluating interactive digital art through the eyes of the practitioners who are embedding evaluation in their creative process as a way of revealing and enhancing their practice. It draws on research methods from other disciplines such as interaction design, human-computer interaction and practice-based research more generally and adapts them to develop new strategies and techniques for how we reflect upon and assess value in the creation and experience of interactive art. With contributions from artists, scientists, curators, entrepreneurs and designers engaged in the creative arts, this book is an invaluable resource for both researchers and practitioners, working in this emerging field.},

  abstract = {While great progress has been made in digitizing the US health care
system, today's health information technology (IT) infrastructure remains
largely a collection of systems that are not designed to support a
transition to value-based care. In addition, the pursuit of value-based
care, in which we deliver better care with better outcomes at lower cost,
places new demands on the health care system that our IT infrastructure
needs to be able to support. Provider organizations pursuing new models of
health care delivery and payment are finding that their electronic systems
lack the capabilities needed to succeed. The result is a chasm between the
current health IT ecosystem and the health IT ecosystem that is
desperately needed.In this paper, we identify a set of focal goals and
associated near-term achievable actions that are critical to pursue in
order to enable the health IT ecosystem to meet the acute needs of modern
health care delivery. These ideas emerged from discussions that occurred
during the 2015 American Medical Informatics Association Policy
Invitational Meeting. To illustrate the chasm and motivate our
recommendations, we created a vignette from the multistakeholder
perspectives of a patient, his provider, and researchers/innovators. It
describes an idealized scenario in which each stakeholder's needs are
supported by an integrated health IT environment. We identify the gaps
preventing such a reality today and present associated policy
recommendations that serve as a blueprint for critical actions that would
enable us to cross the current health IT chasm by leveraging systems and
information to routinely deliver high-value care.},
