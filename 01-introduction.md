# Introduction

This Markdown file is the first file referenced in the _main.tex_ file. Overleaf reads _main.tex_, loading the appropriate LaTeX packages for your document class, which in this template is the Koma-Script article class **scartcl**, which defines how the finished PDF looks. The template uses the ```agsm``` bibliography command, which provides a Harvard referencing style. You can read more Harvard referencing with LaTeX at [this link.](http://tex.loria.fr/bibdex/harvard.pdf)

These packages are responsible for defining the look of your document, which leaves you to concentrate on the important stuff: the text, the images, and the figures.

## This is a sub-heading

As you can see, the chapter/section heading **Introduction** has been generated through the use of a single '\hash' symbol, which is referred to as a **h1** heading within Markdown. The sub-heading for this section is a **h2**, which is the equivalent of two hash symbols, '\hash \hash', in Markdown.  


Accordingly, '\hash \hash \hash' will give you a **h3** sub-sub-heading, and '\hash \hash \hash \hash' will give you a **h4** sub-sub-sub-subheading.
