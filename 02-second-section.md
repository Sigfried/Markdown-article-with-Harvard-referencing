# This is the second section

This section lives in its own file. Using the '```\markdownInput{}```' command you can insert multiple Markdown-formatted documents into the main body of the document.

This is useful for breaking up big chunks of text into single files should you prefer to concentrate on smaller blocks of text. You can of course write your entire report as a single Markdown document if that is more to your taste.

## Handy Markdown tips

You can create unordered lists by using a single hyphen at the start of a sentence.

- This is the first item

- This is the second

- This is the third

Ordered lists work the same way, just start a new sentence with a number, followed by a full stop, then a space, then the item text.

1. First item

2. Second item

3. Third item
