# Conclusion

Hopefully this template will help you get started in writing plain-text Markdown-formatted articles and assignments. Though it is possible to do it all in raw LaTeX code, but it's not particularly pleasant to write in LaTeX directly, even if the output is absolutely beautiful to look at the end of the process.

It might seem a little odd to begin with, but the point of working this way is to concentrate on what is important - the written work. Concentrate on making the work good, and let the system make it look good for you.

Try this template out for yourself. Add some BibTeX references, add some images, write some text for yourself and have a go at citing something. With a little practice you should be able to knock up a pretty sweet looking and properly referenced report in very little time.
